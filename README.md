# 📊 Customer Support Analysis Using Machine Learning

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer support complaints using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from textual data, identify common complaint categories, and classify complaints efficiently. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are utilized for text preprocessing, clustering, and classification.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Perform **Data Analysis** on customer support complaints.
- Utilize **NLP Techniques** to preprocess text data.
- Apply **Text Clustering** using **K-Means Clustering** to group similar complaints.
- Implement **Text Classification** to categorize complaints into predefined classes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 📚 Machine Learning Techniques
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization.
- **Text Clustering**: K-Means Clustering.
- **Text Classification**: Supervised Machine Learning models.

## 📊 Results
- Identified key themes and patterns in customer complaints.
- Grouped similar complaints into clusters.
- Built a text classification model .

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Explore deep learning models for text classification.
- Implement real-time analysis of customer complaints.
